Subject: Web Scraping Project Submission

Dear sir/mam,

I am pleased to submit my web scraping project, which I completed within 24 hours. Below are the instructions for running and verifying the project. If there are any errors or additional changes required, please let me know.

Running the Project
Django Setup:

Navigate to the directory containing manage.py:

D:\intern\web_scrapping\scrap\scrap\spiders\scrapper\django\product_api
Run the Django development server:

"python manage.py runserver" in terminal
React Setup:

Navigate to the directory containing app.js:

D:\intern\web_scrapping\scrap\scrap\spiders\scrapper\product_frontend\src
Start the React application:
"npm start" in terminal
Please ensure that both Django and React are running simultaneously.

Scrapy Configuration
Data Location:
The scraped data will be saved to output1.json at:


D:\intern\web_scraping\scrap\my_new_scrapy_project\my_new_scrapy_project\spiders\output1.json

Scrapy Spider:
The Python file for the Scrapy spider is nobero_spider.py, located at:

D:\intern\web_scraping\scrap\my_new_scrapy_project\my_new_scrapy_project\spiders\nobero_spider.py

Important
If the JSON data has not been imported into the Django schema, please run the following command to load the data:

Dependencies
Please ensure that you have installed the necessary libraries and dependencies, including npm, Django, and Django REST framework, to ensure the project runs smoothly.

Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to work on this project.
looking forward to hearing from you

Best regards,
Shubh Rai
